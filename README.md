## Adding a project

Proud of a project you want to add? Fork the repository, and add a file in [the gallery folder](/content/gallery). Throw in a descriptive title, and a description. You can also add links for the source code and a demo. The following fields can be put in:

```json
{
  "title": "Project Title", // Required Field
  "description": "Project Description", // Required Field
  "source": "Link for source code", // Optional Field
  "demo": "Link for demo" // Optional Field
}
```

Once you're done, just make a PR and we'll add it to the gallery! No project is too small!
